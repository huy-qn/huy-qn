# Huy Q. Nguyen 👦🏻
🖖 Hi, my name is Huy. I am a frontend-developer / designer 💻. 

I am a Vietnamese from Quy Nhơn 🌊, currently living in Houston, US 🌳. 

Outside of my office hours, I like to think and work with Vietnamese devs community to build & ship software for Vietnamese and the world 🚀. 

I believe in kindness, integrity and public transportation powered bots ❤️.
