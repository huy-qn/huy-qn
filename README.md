# Huy Q. Nguyen 👦🏻
🖖 Hi, my name is Huy. I am a frontend-developer / designer 💻

I am a Vietnamese from Quy Nhơn 🌊, currently living in Houston, US 🌳

I like to build, ship and sell my own software for Vietnamese and the world 🚀

I believe in kindness, integrity and public transportation powered bots ❤️ 

I enjoy Vietnamese gangsta rap and green is my favorite color. 🎧
